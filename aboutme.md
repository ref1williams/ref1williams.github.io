# Why am I taking CSCI 103?
I have always been interested in taking a computer science course here at Williams and now that it is my senior year, I felt it would be a good idea to take a course and learn about computer science.  CSCI 103 seemed like the perfect class to introduce concepts of computer science in way comfortable format as I have no prior computer science experience.
