title: Circuit Plushy
---

For this project I had to create a basic plushy doll and sew a basic LED ciruit to it, in order to create a circuit plushy.
Here is the my alligator clamp prototype:

The front of my plushy:

One tip I have now is to make sure that your are sewing the different parts of the circuit with indivisual segments of thread.  Otherwise, the switches will not work prooerly.
