title: Circuit Plushy
---

For this project I had to create a basic plushy doll and sew a basic LED ciruit to it, in order to create a circuit plushy.
Here is the my alligator clamp prototype: ![Sampler](https://github.com/ref1williams/ref1williams.github.io/blob/master/img/alligator.png)
The paper prototype: ![Paper](https://github.com/ref1williams/ref1williams.github.io/blob/master/img/papproto.png)
The front of my plushy: ![Front](https://github.com/ref1williams/ref1williams.github.io/blob/master/img/pfront.png)
The back: ![Back](https://github.com/ref1williams/ref1williams.github.io/blob/master/img/pback.png)
One tip I have now is to make sure that your are sewing the different parts of the curcuit with indivisual segments of thread.  Otherwise the switches will not work prooerly.
