Description: I will create a circuit and code so that the lights and the buzzer will only turn on when the switch is on and it is dark. Buzzer will play Star Wars theme and lights will flash.  Phone will go inside the two pieces of felt that have been sewn together to look like R2-D2. Case will be closed at the top by Velcro to keep your phone in.
