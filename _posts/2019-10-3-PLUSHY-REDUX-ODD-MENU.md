title: Plushy Redux and Odd Menu
---

For the Plushy Redux assignment I had to creat a piece of code that printed on or off depening on if the LEDs on the plushy I made would be on or off. 
Here is what it reutrns when the switch and button or both on:

For the Odd menu assignment I had to creat a piece of code that would print a secret menu if the user chose an odd number or the regular menu if the user chose an even.
Here is the secret menu it printed when using an Odd number

A tip I would use is to be careful with your brackets because when doing the nested IFs I lost track of the placement and amount of brackets.
