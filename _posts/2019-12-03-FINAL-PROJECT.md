title: Bobbyâ€™s R2-D2 Light Up Theme Song Phone Case Locating Device -- Final Project
---

For my final project I created a R2-D2 themed phone case that lights up and plays the Star Wars theme song when it is dark and the switch is on. The LEDs on the front and back alternate flashing.

My motivation for this project was to create a device that I could use to locate my phone if I ever lost it.  By using the light sensor to trigger the mechanism I am able to turn the lights off in my room and easily locate my phone through this case.

Material List: Blue felt, white felt, grey felt, lining fabric, conductive thread, blue embroidery thread, 3 LEDS (white, red, blue), light sensor, buzzer, aurduino board, on-board red led, switch, battery. 

Here is my final Paper Prototype:

3 Tips to my past self:

1. Get ahead on the project as you do not know what problems may arise when actually doing it.
2. Plan out your steps more thoroughly before starting.
3. Using glue in order to add some of the decorative pieces would have been more effective.
